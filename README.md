# Colour-Detection-using-OpenCV 

# About:

Colour detection of image is a simple process of detecting the name of the colour. In Project we can automatically detect the colour as well as its rgb and hex values. So for this, we will have a data file that contains the colour name and its values. Then we will calculate the distance from each color and find the shortest one.

# Requirements:

1.OpenCV https://docs.opencv.org/

2.Pandas https://pandas.pydata.org/

3.Python https://www.python.org/
